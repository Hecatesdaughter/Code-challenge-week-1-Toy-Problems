# Code-challenge-week-1-Toy-Problems
This repository contains 3 code challenges that I solved using knowledge that I learned in and outside of class. The first one is a program that prompts the user to input marks and outputs grades depending on the input value. The second one is a program that takes input of different speeds of cars and outputs different points depending on how much the car is above or below the speed limit. The third challenge is a program that calculates a user's net salary by gettig the inputs of their basic salary and net salary.
All three programs can be set up using a console window on a browser. (ctrl+shift+J)
